# Specifications

Mostly work-in-process specifications, at various stages of development.

## Vocabularies & Goals

### Knowledge Design

* [Research Cases Data Model (W3C Unofficial Draft)](playground/knowledge-design/research-cases/index.html)

  Research Cases are a way to partition research conceptually into _cases_,
  each case organized around a question. They are designed for iterative,
  real-time research publication, and encourage open collaboration and
  discourse throughout the research process.

  We're at the early stages of creating this ontology, and it needs more
  thought and examples, but, in general, the idea is sane.

  We would like to see Research Cases become the default way of ~~publishing~~
  doing research.

* [Research Cases Ontology (Turtle)](playground/knowledge-design/research-cases/rcases.ttl)

  The Research Cases ontology, playground edition.

### Scholarly Commons

The Scholarly Commons is not a website, nor a platform or organization, but an
information space based on common agreement of standards and principles. Partly
it is already there, with many current services, policies and standards already
fitting in, but in many respects we are also still a long way off.

## Pipeline

These specifications are pulled into the publication pipeline for the
[LifePreserver project][lifepreserver] as a git submodule. If you are only
contributing to the specifications herein, you should only need to fork and
contribute to [this repository] to collaborate (that was the entire purpose in
separating the specifications from the main project this way).
