      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Research is everywhere. From informal, such as ad hoc journalism
        investigations, to consumer reports, to formal research, such as stem
        cell research, historical research, to ... </p>

      <p>Research cases work for any hypothesis-driven research. For hundreds
        of years, formal research has been published as static paper documents.
        The advent of the Internet has given us motivation to look at new
        approaches.</p>

      <p>Preservation of the research process is key. It enables collaboration
        and profound, powerful publication. Any researcher should be able to
        publish. Research should be judged based on its quality. Sharing
        negative results will improve critical thinking.</p>
