      <p>Most knowledge found on the Web today is taken at face value. The
        social reputation built up by a knowledge provider is the only thing
        that influences trust. For a news provider this might be adequate, yet
        for other things it would be helpful, or even necessary, to see how
        that knowledge was created before placing trust in it.</p>

      <p>Research is the creation of knowledge. We see the research process as
        being made of little building blocks that are put together in various
        ways as research progresses.</p>

      <p>The Research Cases Vocabulary is a lightweight framework for
        explicitly describing research on the Web. Research Cases preserve the
        process of knowledge creation, and allow research to be built upon and
        shared openly across platforms and research disciplines.</p>

      <p>Research Cases broaden the scope of what has traditionally been
        thought of as <em>research</em>, modeling it simply as a search for an
        answer to a question. Research Cases are intended to be used from
        simple to complex, but always involve the process of knowledge
        creation.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      
      <p>Research is the creation of knowledge. Research is everywhere
        knowledge is found. Theoretically, every piece of knowledge could trace
        its roots back to some bit of research that discovered it. From
        informal, such as ad hoc journalism investigations, to consumer
        reports, to formal research, such as stem cell research, historical
        research, to ... </p>

      <p>Research cases work for any hypothesis-driven research. For hundreds
        of years, formal research has been published as static paper documents.
        The advent of the Internet has given us motivation to look at new
        approaches.</p>

      <p>Preservation of the research process is key. It enables collaboration
        and profound, powerful publication. Any researcher should be able to
        publish. Research should be judged based on its quality. Sharing
        negative results will improve critical thinking.</p>

      <p>Research Cases are persistent, curated resources.</p>

      <h2>Design Goals and Rationale</h2>

      <p>Research cases satisfies the following design goals:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Lightweight</dt>
        <dd>Easy to share; flexible.</dd>
        <dt>Simplicity</dt>
        <dd>Easy for people to build with.</dd>
        <dt>Domain agnostic</dt>
        <dd>Should work for any domain of knowledge. Should also be able
          interoperate across domains of knowledge.</dd>

          <dd>Data is raw, uninterpreted stuff.</dd>
          <dt>Information</dt>
          <dd>Information is interpreted data.</dd>
          <dt>Evidence</dt>
          <dd>Evidence is information interpreted in the context of the
            research question.</dd>

          <dd>A curated unit of research, bounded by a Question and
            a Conclusion.</dd>
