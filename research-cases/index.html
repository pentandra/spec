    <section id="abstract">

      <p>The Research Cases Vocabulary is a lightweight, task-oriented
      framework for doing research on the World Wide Web. Research Cases make
      knowledge creation explicit and allow research and knowledge to be built
      upon and shared openly and in context across platforms and research
      disciplines.</p>

      <p>Research Cases broaden the scope of what has traditionally been
      thought of as <em>research</em>, modeling it holistically as the process
      the researcher goes through from an initial research question all the way
      to the resultant answer. Research Cases are intended to be powerful
      enough to handle the most complex and intricate of research problems
      using compositions of interrelated research cases, and flexible enough to
      be useful in answering simple, solitary questions that formerly we may
      not have considered to be <em>research</em>. Whatever the scope, research
      cases always involve the process of knowledge creation.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Most knowledge found on the Web today is taken at face value. The
      social reputation built up by a knowledge provider is the only thing that
      influences trust. For a news provider this might be adequate, yet for
      other things it would be helpful, or even necessary, to see how that
      knowledge was created before placing trust in it.</p>

      <p>Research is the creation of knowledge. We see the research process as
      being made of little building blocks that are put together in various
      ways as research progresses.</p>

      <p>Research is the creation of knowledge. Research is everywhere
      knowledge is found. Theoretically, every piece of knowledge could trace
      its roots back to some bit of research that discovered it. From informal,
      such as ad hoc journalism investigations, to consumer reports, to formal
      research, such as stem cell research, historical research, to ... </p>

      <p>Research cases work for any hypothesis-driven research. For hundreds
      of years, formal research has been published as static paper documents.
      The advent of the Internet has given us motivation to look at new
      approaches.</p>

      <p>Preservation of the research process is key. It enables collaboration
      and profound, powerful publication. Any researcher should be able to
      publish. Research should be judged based on its quality. Sharing negative
      results will improve critical thinking.</p>

      <p>Research Cases are persistent, curated resources.</p>

      <h2>Design Goals and Rationale</h2>

      <p>Research cases satisfies the following design goals:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Lightweight</dt>
        <dd>Easy to share; flexible.</dd>
        <dt>Simplicity</dt>
        <dd>Easy for people to build with.</dd>
        <dt>Domain agnostic</dt>
        <dd>Should work for any domain of knowledge. Should also be able
          interoperate across domains of knowledge.</dd>
