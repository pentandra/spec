    <section id="abstract">

      <p>The Research Cases vocabulary is a lightweight, task-oriented framework for doing research on the World Wide Web. Research Cases make knowledge creation explicit and allow research and knowledge to be built upon and shared openly and in context across platforms and research disciplines.</p>

      <p>Research Cases broaden the scope of what has traditionally been thought of as <em>research</em>, modeling it holistically as the process the researcher goes through from an initial research question all the way to the resultant answer. Research Cases are intended to be powerful enough to handle the most complex and intricate of research problems by composing interrelated research cases into one uniform whole, and flexible enough to be useful in answering simple, solitary questions that, formally, we may not have considered to be research. Whatever the scope, research cases always involve the process of knowledge creation.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Most knowledge found on the Web today is taken at face value. The social reputation built up by a knowledge provider is the only thing that influences trust. For a news provider this might be adequate, yet for other things it would be helpful, or even necessary, to see how that knowledge was created before placing trust in it.</p>

      <p>Research is the creation of knowledge. We see the research process as being made of little building blocks that are put together in various ways as research progresses.</p>

      <p>Research is the creation of knowledge. Research is everywhere knowledge is found. Theoretically, every piece of knowledge could trace its roots back to some bit of research that discovered it. From informal, such as ad hoc journalism investigations, to consumer reports, to formal research, such as stem cell research, historical research, to ... </p>

      <p>Research cases work for any hypothesis-driven research. For hundreds of years, formal research has been published as static paper documents.  The advent of the Internet has given us motivation to look at new approaches.</p>

      <p>Preservation of the research process is key. It enables collaboration and profound, powerful publication. Any researcher should be able to publish. Research should be judged based on its quality. Sharing negative results will improve critical thinking.</p>

      <p>Research Cases are persistent, curated resources.</p>

      <h2>Design Goals and Rationale</h2>

      <p>Research cases satisfies the following design goals:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Lightweight</dt>
        <dd>Easy to share; flexible.</dd>
        <dt>Simplicity</dt>
        <dd>Easy for people to build with.</dd>
        <dt>Domain agnostic</dt>
        <dd>Should work for any domain of knowledge. Should also be able interoperate across domains of knowledge.</dd>
